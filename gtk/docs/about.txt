      The Mosquito or Mosquito alarm (marketed as the Beethoven in France and the Swiss-Mosquito in Switzerland)
      is an electronic device, used for solving loitering problems, which emits a sound with a high frequency. 

      The newest version of the device, launched late in 2008, has two frequency settings, one of approximately  
      17.4 kHzthat can generally be heard only by young people, and another at 8 kHz that can be heard by 
      most people.

      The maximum potential output sound pressure level is stated by the manufacturer to be 108 decibels (dB). 
      The sound can typically only be heard by people below 25 years of age, as the ability to hear high frequencies 
      deteriorates in humans with age (a phenomenon known as presbycusis).

      The device is marketed as a safety and security tool for preventing youths from congregating in specific areas. 
      As such, it is promoted to reduce anti-social behaviour such as loitering, graffiti, vandalism, drug use, 
      drug distribution, and violence. In the UK, over 3,000 have been sold, mainly for use outside shops and near 
      transport hubs. 

      The device is also sold in Australia, France, Denmark, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and the USA.
